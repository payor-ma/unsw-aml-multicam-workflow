aims:
-Post work offset coordinate system
-Default tolerance to 0.05
-Default to optional stop on

- post two decimal places

-Post Header including - mention of DFL post, xyz space of tool, WCS xyz offsets, tools used (number, description, min z's, max z's)
- Warnings about below z0, exceeded z height, collet collision warnings, etc. - consult clearance etc

-Insert M1 before first G1 after M6
- on toolchange
- after drilling for hold down

-Move to first X,Y before spinning up spindle
-Return tool and return to park at finish option




START
-> WAIT?
-HIGH FEEDRATE OVERRATE option? - Spindle not spinning, then optional stop for first entry

->Picked up tool

->Start spindle ???

->Move to first XY
-> OPTIONAL STOP
->Start spindle
->CUT


DONT CARE ABOUT
-write machine
-write tool list
-sequence start
-sequence increment
-use of numbers
-output coolant commands
-separate with space
-use m6
-allow helical

-built in feedrate mapping
-circ rad
-chord length


WANT
-optional stop -> CAN WE ENABLE DIFFERENT TYPES
-tolerance

-optional vac / dust
