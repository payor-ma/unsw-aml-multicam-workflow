The foam dustbool seals provided by Multicam have a tendency to slip out of their retaining area and get caught in tools during spinning up and down of the spindle.  They also only come in one height.  I've found that if you're doing a lot of 2D full depth work with a tool, its worth making a good seal above the boot with a custom foam insert to aid extraction, reduce mess and sometimes even improve surface finish.  I've whipped up a few foam dustboot seals of different heights, that can be cut down to a custom size depending on the job.
