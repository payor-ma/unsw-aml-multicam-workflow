Equipment settings defined in the *MachineAdjustableParams.xml files on the multicam hard drives manage the use of relay controlled dust extraction, vacuum pump and mister.

On our SL2515v, a vacuum and dust extraction relay are installed, there is no mister relay installed.
On our M2412, there are no relays installed for external equipment.

Mode fields under equipment settings define their use by the machines.
By trial and error, I hypothesise that for a parameter of format <*Mode>X</*Mode>, X can take on the following values:
'0' : Unused / no relay installed
'1' : Usable but not automatically triggered by the machine.  Can be activated with M-Codes by controller / when executing an nc file.
'2' : Automatically triggered by the machine to turn on prior to executing an nc file and turn off at the completion of the file's execution.  Also able to be controlled through M-Codes.
